pudding = Recipe.create(name: "Vegan Coconut Banana Pudding", ingredients: "4 cups Vegan Peanut Butter Pudding, 3 cups full-fat coconut milk or cream, Stevia or powdered sugar",
        instructions: "If you haven’t already, prepare your Peanut Butter Pudding and chill (cover with plastic wrap to prevent film). Set in refrigerator.
        If you haven’t already, prepare a double batch of coconut whipped cream, using full-fat coconut milk or coconut cream and sweetening to taste with stevia or powdered sugar. Set in refrigerator.
        In a large mixing bowl, use a rubber spatula to gently mix together pudding and half of the coconut whipped cream.
        In a 9x13 inch (or comparable size) pan, begin by adding a layer of vanilla wafers (reserving some wafers for the top layer). Using three of the bananas, add a layer of thinly sliced bananas on top of the vanilla wafers.
        For the next layer, top bananas with the pudding-coconut-whip mixture. Smooth the top with a wooden spoon. Use the same method to top with the remaining coconut whipped cream.
        Cover and place in the refrigerator to chill for at least 4-6 hours, preferably overnight. Remove from fridge and top with a layer of loosely arranged sliced bananas. Crush remaining wafers and sprinkle on top. Sprinkle with crushed peanuts (if using).",

        Serve ice cold.",

 kalesalad = Recipe.create(name: "Massaged Kale Salad", 
        ingredients: "2 large bundles curly kale, 1 Tbsp lemon juice, 1 Tbsp extra virgin olive oil, 1 healthy pinch sea salt. DRESSING: 1/3 cup tahini, 3 Tbsp lemon juice, 1-2 Tbsp maple syrup, 1 pinch sea salt, Water to thin", 
        instructions: "Once you’ve rinsed and dried your kale, run your hand along the stem to remove the green leaves from the stalky stem. You don’t have to remove the stem completely, but be sure to compost or reserve the larger bottom stalks for DIY vegetable broth. Stack your stalks of kale on top of each other and finely chop. No need to mince, just cut into manageable, bite-size pieces. Add kale to a large mixing / serving bowl and top with lemon juice and extra virgin olive oil. Then massage with clean hands for about 3 minutes. The point of massaging is to infuse the kale with the lemon juice and oil, and also to break down some of the tough, fibrous characteristics of kale. This makes it easier to chew and digest, and makes for a more tender salad. Season with salt, massage/toss once more, then set aside.
        Next prepare the dressing by adding tahini, lemon juice, maple syrup, and salt (optional) to a medium mixing bowl. Whisk to combine. Then slowly add water until creamy and pourable. The mixture may seize up and thicken at first, but continue adding water a little at a time, whisking until creamy and smooth. Taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding more lemon juice for acidity, maple syrup for sweetness, or salt to taste. Set aside. (Store leftover dressing in the refrigerator up to 5-7 days — sometimes longer.)
        To serve, top with desired amount of dressing and crispy chickpeas (optional), toss, and serve. Leftovers keep covered in the refrigerator up to 3-4 days (not freezer friendly).",

roastedchicken = Recipe.create(name: "Lemon Rosemary Roasted Chicken", 
        ingredients: "1 3-4 pound whole chicken, 2 Tbsp melted butter (Miyoko’s or Earth Balance for dairy-free, 3/4-1 Tbsp sea salt, 1-2 tsp black pepper, 1 small lemon - rinsed and quartered, 4 sprigs fresh rosemary (or sub thyme)",
        instructions: "Set chicken on a clean plate then wash hands with hot soapy water. Melt butter and drizzle over the skin of the chicken and brush to distribute evenly. Season the exterior and interior cavity of the chicken with salt and pepper (as the recipe is written, about 3/4-1 Tbsp sea salt and 1-2 tsp black pepper). This sounds like a lot of salt, but there should be a generous layer of seasoning on the chicken so it flavors the meat well. (For a roughly 4 lb. chicken, we used about 1 Tbsp salt and 2 tsp black pepper total.) Insert the lemon and fresh rosemary into the cavity — this infuses more flavor and also makes for a more flavorful broth (if making broth afterward). Set the chicken in the fridge uncovered (this allows the chicken to dry out a bit, which helps it crisp more when roasting). Wait 24-36 hours (ideally) or at least 8-10 hours to cook. At this time, be sure to wash hands with hot soapy water again and clean all surfaces well to avoid spreading bacteria. Once you’re ready to cook your chicken, preheat oven to 450 degrees F (232 C). Get out a large rimmed roasting pan or cast-iron skillet (we like this baking dish). If adding veggies (optional) add carrots and potatoes to the pan. Drizzle with a bit of oil and season well with salt and pepper. Then toss to combine. Arrange the veggies around the perimeter of the dish, then add the chicken (breast side up) in the center (if not baking with veggies, just place chicken in center of pan). Bake for 45 minutes to 1 hour 15 minutes (UNCOVERED) or until the exterior is crispy and golden brown and the internal temperature of the thickest part of the thigh reads 165 F (74 C). I also like to measure the breast temperature to ensure it’s done in the center as well (also 165 F / 74 C). For an accurate read, be sure the thermometer is not touching bone. Remove from oven and let chicken rest for about 10-15 minutes before serving. This ensures the juices redistribute to keep the chicken moist. To slice the chicken, use a sharp knife to remove the wings and the thighs (option to cut the leg/drumstick from the thigh for easier serving portions). Then slice down either side of the breast bone and thinly slice the breasts into 1/4-inch serving portions. Use hands to carefully remove any other parts of meat from the bones. Lastly, if opting to make bone broth, save the bones (including the legs and wings after meat has been removed).
        To serve, arrange the carrots and potatoes on a serving platter and top with pieces of chicken. You will likely have a generous portion of cooking juices left over in the roasting pan, which I recommend transferring to a small dish and serving on the side to add more flavor as a lazy but delicious form of 'gravy.'",
